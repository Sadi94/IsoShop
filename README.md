# IsometricShop
Laravel Project

The Isometric Shop is making healthcare accessible to a large number of people. Its aims are to empower patients to better manage their health and healthcare system
at our doorstep. This online shop brings people to a digital platform where they can select and buy medicines and other health components

Next-day delivery is more convenient for people than buying medicine in the store. The pandemic has changed the way we buy and sell things. The medical industry is not 
an exception. More and more people, especially the elderly don’t want to leave their homes for no good reason and prefer to order goods online. Using this problem people 
are able to find a way where they will find a trustable agent where they will get their medicines or medical components of their problem. If we want to give an example 
aroggo.com is a perfect solution where they provide some pharmacy services.

There are 4-types of Users here. They are:
•	Admin
•	Seller
•	Customer
•	Service Provider

Impact of this Project:

Since the covid-19 pandemic there has been a notable increase in the purchase of medicine online. The pandemic has changed the way we buy and sell things. Across the
globe also modern pharmacy increasing due to internet penetration, and consumer convenience in modern society. Buying medicine online can have a number of benefits 
for many people such as easy access, search for medicine, ordering medicine, less time, etc.

Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:
One of the disadvantages of this project is that there is no one you can contact face to face. When users want to ask questions about the products they are taking,
it is very difficult for them to find a good product. For this reason in the future live chat or call option can be added here.
